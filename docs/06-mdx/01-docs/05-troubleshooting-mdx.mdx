本文讨论了使用MDX时可能出现的几个常见问题和错误。 {/* more */}
要了解MDX格式是如何工作的，我们建议您从[§什么是MDX][what]开始。
如何使用[我们的包](/packages/)在它们的自述中有文档说明。
要迁移到最新的MDX，请参见[§从v1迁移到v2][migration-v2]。

## 整合MDX的问题

### ESM

如果您在将MDX与不同的工具集成时遇到问题，那很可能是由于ESM: ECMAScript模块。
它们自2015年以来一直在工作，我们从一开始就在MDX文件中支持它们，在MDX版本2中我们完全切换到它们。
许多工具已经支持ESM。
大多数其他工具正在努力支持它们。
有些仍然需要额外的配置。

有一个很棒的[Gist by **@sindresorhus**](https://gist.github.com/sindresorhus/a39789f98801d908bbc7ff3ecc99d99c)，它详细解释了如何将ESM与许多不同的工具一起使用。
如果您在使用MDX、其他工具和ESM时遇到了问题，那么您可能会在这里找到所需的工具。
请把它通读一下。
如果仍然有问题，与MDX集成的工具的问题跟踪器可能会提供答案。

如果您在使用不支持ESM的工具(如Electron)时遇到麻烦，一个短期解决方案是使用捆绑器来制作CJS版本。

<details>
  <summary>展开一个制作CJS包的例子</summary>

使用[esbuild](https://esbuild.github.io)，这将ESM包`@mdx-js/mdx`捆绑为`vendor/mdx.js`中的CJS:

```sh
npx esbuild @mdx-js/mdx --bundle --platform=node --outfile=vendor/mdx.js
```

</details>

## 使用MDX的问题

使用MDX时出现的问题通常与[我们的包](/packages/)的api以及如何使用它们有关。
有关更多信息和示例，请参阅所使用的包、函数和选项的文档。

### `` `options.renderer`不再被支持 ``

这个错误是由我们的webpack加载器[`@mdx-js/loader`](/packages/loader/)抛出的。
它是在版本2中引入以帮助迁移的。

`renderer`选项允许在每个编译的MDX文件之前注入任意文本。
这通常用于支持React以外的框架，如Preact。
我们现在有了诸如`jsxImportSource`之类的选项，并且可以使用`recmaPlugins`添加任意JavaScript。
因为版本2使用基于AST的方法，所以支持`渲染器`不再可行，所以它被删除了。

Please see [¶ Preact in § Getting started](/docs/getting-started/#preact) for
how to support Preact.
See [¶ Creating plugins in § Extending MDX](/docs/extending-mdx/#creating-plugins)
for how to create plugins.

### `` Incorrect `format: 'detect'` ``

The full error message is as follows:

```txt chrome=no
Incorrect `format: 'detect'`: `createProcessor` can support either `md` or `mdx`; it does not support detecting the format
```

This error is thrown by [`@mdx-js/mdx`](/packages/mdx/), our core compiler.
It was introduced in version 2 when the `format` option was introduced.

The `format` option, when configured with `'detect'`, allows inferring whether a
file is MDX or plain markdown.
Based on that information, plugins are configured differently, and with
different options.
This is impossible with unified.

To detect the format of passed files, please either use `compile` from
`@mdx-js/mdx` or one of the integrations.

### `` Missing `pragma` in classic runtime with `pragmaImportSource` ``

This error is thrown by [`@mdx-js/mdx`](/packages/mdx/), our core compiler.
It was introduced in version 2 when the `jsxRuntime`, `pragma`, and
`pragmaImportSource` options were introduced.

This error is thrown when `jsxRuntime` is configured with `'classic'` (the
default is `'automatic'`), `pragmaImportSource` is defined (the default is
`'react'`), but `pragma` is defined as a falsey value (the default is
`React.createElement`).

If you are using the classic runtime, you have to define a `pragma`.

### `` Expected `Fragment` given to `evaluate` ``

### `` Expected `jsx` given to `evaluate` ``

### `` Expected `jsxs` given to `evaluate` ``

These errors are thrown by [`@mdx-js/mdx`](/packages/loader/), our core
compiler.
They were introduced in version 2 when `evaluate` (and `evaluateSync`) were
introduced.

`evaluate` supports React and other frameworks.
But these frameworks must support an automatic JSX runtime that exposes these
three exports.
If you’re getting this error, that means that either a) the framework does not
support the automatic JSX runtime, or b) that you’re not passing them correctly
to `evaluate`.

Please see [`evaluate` in `@mdx-js/mdx`](/packages/mdx/#evaluatefile-options)
for examples on how to pass these values.

## 编写MDX的问题

Problems that occur when writing MDX typically have to do with how to combine
JS(X) and markdown.
It’s an odd mix of two languages: markdown is **whitespace sensitive** and
**forgiving** (what you type may not exactly work but it won’t crash) whereas
JavaScript is **whitespace insensitive** and **unforgiving** (it does crash on
typos).

Errors typically fall in these three categories:

- **Not escaping `<` and `{`**
  — Escape these (`\<`, `\{`) if you mean them as plain text instead of JS(X)
- **Incorrect interleaving**
  — See the rules in
  [¶ Interleaving in § What is MDX?](/docs/what-is-mdx/#interleaving)
- **Broken JavaScript**
  — Make sure the JavaScript you write is valid

### `Could not parse import/exports with acorn: $error`

This error is thrown by our MDX parser.
It was introduced in version 2.
It occurs when the keywords `import` or `export` are found at the start of a
line but they are not followed by valid JavaScript.
An example is:

```mdx chrome=no
import 1/

1
```

The reason for this error is that the parser is expecting a JavaScript import or
export statement.
If you want the word import or export, make sure it’s not at the start of a
paragraph.
If you do want an import or export statement, please make sure that it’s valid
JavaScript.

### ``Unexpected `$type` in code: only import/exports are supported``

This error is thrown by our MDX parser.
It was introduced in version 2.
It occurs when, after an `import` or `export` statement, more JavaScript is
found.
An example is:

```mdx chrome=no
export const a = 1
const b =

2
```

The reason for this error is that we only allow `import` and `export` to define
data.
If you want to define a variable or function, please export it.

### `` Unexpected end of file in expression, expected a corresponding closing brace for `{` ``

This error is thrown by our MDX parser.
It was introduced in version 2.
It occurs when there is an opening curly brace not followed by a closing brace.
An example is:

```mdx chrome=no
a { b
```

The reason for this error is that the parser is expecting another curly brace.
If you just want a brace but not an expression, escape it: `\{`.
If you do want an expression, please make sure to close it with a closing brace
`}`.
If there is a closing brace somewhere, make sure that the braces are each on
their own lines with no text before the opening brace and no text after the
closing brace, or that there are no blank lines between the braces.

### `Could not parse expression with acorn: $error`

This error is thrown by our MDX parser.
It was introduced in version 2.
It occurs when there are matching curly braces that, when interpreting what’s
inside them as JavaScript, results in a syntax error.
An example is:

```mdx chrome=no
a {const b = 'c'} d
```

Another example:

```mdx chrome=no
a {!} d
```

The reason for this error is that the parser is expecting a JavaScript
expression.
If you just want braces instead of an expression, escape the opening: `\{`.
If you do want an expression, make sure that it’s valid JavaScript and that it
is an expression.
That means statements (such as `if` and `else` and `for` loops) do not work.
If you need complex logic, you can wrap statements and whole programs into an
IIFE, or move it out to a different file, export it from there, and import it in
MDX.

### `Could not parse expression with acorn: Unexpected content after expression`

This error is thrown by our MDX parser.
It was introduced in version 2.
It occurs when there are matching curly braces that, and valid JavaScript is
inside them, but there’s too much JavaScript.
An example is:

```mdx chrome=no
a {'b' 'c'} d
```

The reason for this error is that the parser is expecting a single JavaScript
expression yielding one value.
If you just want braces instead of an expression, escape the opening: `\{`.
If you do want an expression, make sure that it yields a single value.

### `Unexpected extra content in spread: only a single spread is supported`

This error is thrown by our MDX parser.
It was introduced in version 2.
It occurs when there are multiple values spread into a JSX tag.
An example is:

```mdx chrome=no
<div {...values, ...other} />
```

The reason for this error is that JSX only allows spreading a single value at a
time:

```mdx chrome=no
<div {...values} {...other} />
```

### ``Unexpected `$type` in code: only spread elements are supported``

### `Unexpected empty expression`

These errors are thrown by our MDX parser.
They were introduced in version 2.
They occur when something other than a spread is used in braces.
An example is:

```mdx chrome=no
<div {values} {/* comment */} {} />
```

The reason for this error is that JSX only allows spreading values:

```mdx chrome=no
<div {...values} />
```

### `Unexpected end of file $at, expected $expect`

### `Unexpected character $at, expected $expect`

These errors are thrown by our MDX parser.
They were introduced in MDX version 2.
They occur when something unexpected was found in a JSX tag.
Some examples are:

```mdx chrome=no
<
<.>
</
</.>
<a
<a?>
<a:
<a:+>
<a.
<a./>
<a b
<a b!>
<a b:
<a b:1>
<a b=
<a b=>
<a b="
<a b='
<a b={
<a/
<a/->
```

The reason for these errors is that JSX has a very strict grammar and expects
tags to be valid.
There are different solutions depending on what was expected.
Please read the error message carefully as it indicates where the problem
occurred and what was expected instead.

### ``Unexpected closing slash `/` in tag, expected an open tag first``

This error is thrown by our MDX parser.
It was introduced in version 2.
It occurs when a closing tag is found but there are no open tags.
An example is:

```mdx chrome=no
</div>
```

The reason for this error is that only open tags can be closed.
You probably forgot an opening tag somewhere.

### `Unexpected attribute in closing tag, expected the end of the tag`

This error is thrown by our MDX parser.
It was introduced in version 2.
It occurs when attributes are placed on closing tags.
An example is:

```mdx chrome=no
<h1>Text</h1 id="text">
```

The reason for this error is that only open tags can have attributes.
Move these attributes to the corresponding opening tag.

### ``Unexpected self-closing slash `/` in closing tag, expected the end of the tag``

This error is thrown by our MDX parser.
It was introduced in version 2.
It occurs when a closing tag is also marked as self-closing.
An example is:

```mdx chrome=no
<h1>Text</h1/>
```

The reason for this error is that only opening tags can be marked as
self-closing.
Remove the slash after the tag name and before `>`.

### ``Unexpected closing tag `</$tag>`, expected corresponding closing tag for `<$tag>` ($at)``

This error is thrown by our MDX parser.
It was introduced in version 2.
It occurs when a closing tag is seen that does not match the expected opening
tag.
An example is:

```mdx chrome=no
<a>Text</b>
```

The reason for this error is that tags must match in JSX.
You likely forgot to open or close one of the two correctly.

### ``Cannot close `$type` ($at): a different token (`$type`, $at) is open``

### ``Cannot close document, a token (`$type`, $at) is still open``

This error is thrown by our MDX parser.
It was introduced in version 2.
It typically occurs when markdown and JSX are not interleaved correctly.
An example is:

```mdx chrome=no
> <div>
```

The reason for this error is that a markdown construct ends while there are
still tags open.
