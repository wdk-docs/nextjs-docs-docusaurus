快速刷新是Next.js的一个特性，它可以在对React组件进行编辑时提供即时反馈。
在**9.4或更新版本**的所有Next.js应用程序中默认启用快速刷新。
启用Next.js快速刷新后，大多数编辑应该在一秒钟内可见，**而不会丢失组件状态**。

## 它是如何工作的

- 如果你编辑了一个只导出React组件的文件，快速刷新将只更新该文件的代码，并重新渲染你的组件。
  您可以编辑该文件中的任何内容，包括样式、呈现逻辑、事件处理程序或效果。
- If you edit a file with exports that _aren't_ React components, Fast Refresh
  will re-run both that file, and the other files importing it. So if both
  `Button.js` and `Modal.js` import `theme.js`, editing `theme.js` will update
  both components.
- 最后，如果你编辑的文件**是由React树之外的文件**导入的，快速刷新**将会退回到完全重新加载**。
  你可能有一个文件，它呈现了一个React组件，但也导出了一个由非React组件导入的值。
  例如，也许你的组件也导出了一个常量，而一个非react实用程序文件导入了它。
  在这种情况下，请考虑将常量迁移到单独的文件中，并将其导入两个文件。
  这将重新启用快速刷新工作。其他情况通常可以用类似的方法解决。

## 错误的弹性

### 语法错误

If you make a syntax error during development, you can fix it and save the file
again. The error will disappear automatically, so you won't need to reload the
app. **You will not lose component state**.

### 运行时错误

If you make a mistake that leads to a runtime error inside your component,
you'll be greeted with a contextual overlay. Fixing the error will automatically
dismiss the overlay, without reloading the app.

Component state will be retained if the error did not occur during rendering. If
the error did occur during rendering, React will remount your application using
the updated code.

If you have [error boundaries](https://react.dev/reference/react/Component#catching-rendering-errors-with-an-error-boundary)
in your app (which is a good idea for graceful failures in production), they
will retry rendering on the next edit after a rendering error. This means having
an error boundary can prevent you from always getting reset to the root app
state. However, keep in mind that error boundaries shouldn't be _too_ granular.
They are used by React in production, and should always be designed
intentionally.

## 限制

Fast Refresh tries to preserve local React state in the component you're
editing, but only if it's safe to do so. Here's a few reasons why you might see
local state being reset on every edit to a file:

- Local state is not preserved for class components (only function components
  and Hooks preserve state).
- The file you're editing might have _other_ exports in addition to a React
  component.
- Sometimes, a file would export the result of calling a higher-order component
  like `HOC(WrappedComponent)`. If the returned component is a
  class, its state will be reset.
- Anonymous arrow functions like `export default () => <div />;` cause Fast Refresh to not preserve local component state. For large codebases you can use our [`name-default-component` codemod](/docs/pages/building-your-application/upgrading/codemods#name-default-component).

As more of your codebase moves to function components and Hooks, you can expect
state to be preserved in more cases.

## 提示

- 默认情况下，快速刷新在函数组件(和Hooks)中保留React本地状态。
- Sometimes you might want to _force_ the state to be reset, and a component to
  be remounted. For example, this can be handy if you're tweaking an animation
  that only happens on mount. To do this, you can add `// @refresh reset`
  anywhere in the file you're editing. This directive is local to the file, and
  instructs Fast Refresh to remount components defined in that file on every
  edit.
- You can put `console.log` or `debugger;` into the components you edit during
  development.

## 快速刷新和挂钩

When possible, Fast Refresh attempts to preserve the state of your component
between edits. In particular, `useState` and `useRef` preserve their previous
values as long as you don't change their arguments or the order of the Hook
calls.

Hooks with dependencies—such as `useEffect`, `useMemo`, and `useCallback`—will
_always_ update during Fast Refresh. Their list of dependencies will be ignored
while Fast Refresh is happening.

For example, when you edit `useMemo(() => x * 2, [x])` to
`useMemo(() => x * 10, [x])`, it will re-run even though `x` (the dependency)
has not changed. If React didn't do that, your edit wouldn't reflect on the
screen!

Sometimes, this can lead to unexpected results. For example, even a `useEffect`
with an empty array of dependencies would still re-run once during Fast Refresh.

However, writing code resilient to occasional re-running of `useEffect` is a good practice even
without Fast Refresh. It will make it easier for you to introduce new dependencies to it later on
and it's enforced by [React Strict Mode](/docs/pages/api-reference/next-config-js/reactStrictMode),
which we highly recommend enabling.
